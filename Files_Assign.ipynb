        "Ans - The logging module in Python is a tool used to record events that occur during the execution of a program. It's a powerful way to track errors, warnings, and informational messages, which is helpful for debugging, troubleshooting, and monitoring your application. Logging provides a structured way to keep a record of what's happening within your code, making it easier to understand the behavior of your application and identify potential issues."

        "\n",
        "Ans  -\n",
        "1. Memory Leaks\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Circular References:\n",
        "Python's reference counting system can struggle with circular references where two or more objects point to each other, preventing the garbage collector from deallocating them, leading to memory leaks.\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Unreleased Resources:\n",
        "Memory allocated by a Python program might not be automatically freed when it's no longer needed, potentially leading to gradual memory consumption and slowdowns.\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Impact on Performance:\n",
        "Memory leaks can significantly impact application performance, causing slowdowns, crashes, or errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Cost Implications:\n",
        "For cloud-based applications, memory leaks can lead to increased RAM usage, necessitating upgrades and higher costs.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Performance Issues\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Garbage Collection Latency:\n",
        "The garbage collector, while beneficial, can introduce latency spikes during collection cycles, which can be a problem in real-time or performance-critical applications\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Fragmentation:\n",
        "Dynamic memory allocation can lead to memory fragmentation, where allocated memory is not contiguous, potentially reducing efficiency and leading to allocation failures.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Challenges with Large Datasets\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Memory Exhaustion:\n",
        "Working with large datasets can lead to memory errors if the program attempts to load or process too much data at once.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Other Considerations\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Over-optimization:\n",
        "While optimizing memory usage is important, it's crucial not to over-optimize and sacrifice code readability and maintainability.\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Learning Curve:\n",
        "Understanding the nuances of Python's memory management can require dedicated effort, especially for developers unfamiliar with the inner workings of the language."

        "1.  Improves Responsiveness (especially in GUIs)\n",
        "\n",
        "Multithreading keeps the main thread free (like the UI thread), while background tasks (e.g., downloads, I/O) run in parallel.\n",

        "Python threads are useful for I/O-bound tasks — like reading/writing files, making network requests, or waiting for user input.\n",
        "\n",
        "While one thread waits for data (e.g., API call), others can keep running.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Concurrency Without Forking\n",
